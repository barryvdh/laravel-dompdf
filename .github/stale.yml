  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
  recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. 
  
  Any issues with PDF rendering itself that are not directly related to this package, 
  should be reported on https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf instead. 
  When having doubts, please try to reproduce the issue with just dompdf.
  
  If you believe this is an actual issue with the latest version of laravel-dompdf, 
  please reply to this issue so we can investigate further.
